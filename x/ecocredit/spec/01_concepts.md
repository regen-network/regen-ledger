## Credit Type

A credit type is the top-level category of credit. Each credit class is associated with a credit type. A credit type is defined by a name (e.g. carbon, biodiversity), an abbreviation (i.e. a unique 1-3 character uppercase abbreviation used in credit batch denominations), a measurement unit (e.g. kilograms, tons), and a decimal precision.

## Credit Class

A credit class is associated with a credit type and includes metadata that defines a methodology for measuring and monitoring ecological state. The metadata within a credit class defines the structure, procedures, and requirements of the methodology. A credit class is created and maintained by a credit class designer and includes a list of approved credit issuers.

## Credit Designer

A credit designer is the authority responsible for creating a credit class and maintaining its list of approved credit issuers. A credit designer is represented by an address.

## Credit Issuer

A credit issuer is the authority responsible for issuing credit batches upon successful satisfaction of methodology constraints. A credit issuer is represented by an address.

## Credit Batch

Credits are issued in batches by credit issuers granted the authority to issue credits for a given credit class. A credit batch refers to a batch of credits issued at a single point in time. Each credit batch has a unique ID (i.e. denomination) that starts with the abbreviation of the credit type.

## Credits

Credits is loose term for any fractional amount of a credit batch. Credits are issued in credit batches for a given credit class by an approved credit issuer.

## Tradable Credits

Tradable credits are credit that can be transferred between accounts.

## Retired Credits

Retired credits are credits that cannot be transferred between accounts nor can they be unretired. Retired credits are equivalent to burned tokens with the exception that retired credits are actively tracked after being retired. Retiring a credit implies that the holder of a credit is “consuming” the credit as an offset. Credits can be immediately retired on issuance.
