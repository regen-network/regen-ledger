# Concepts

These three functionalities each provide different kinds of information and guarantees
about the data being referenced.

- __Data Anchoring__: Proving that a piece of data was known to exist at a certain point
  in time. This can also be referred to as "secure timestamping".
- __Data Signing__: Asserting to the veracity and validity of a piece of data. Signing
  implies that the contents of the data are generally accepted to be true by the signer.
- __Data Storing__: Storing the raw data itself on the blockchain. This is useful when 
  availability guarantees are necessary. This can also be useful in cases where one
  wants smart contracts to have direct access to the data itself.
