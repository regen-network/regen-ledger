# Specifications

All documents within this directory are living documents. The functionality and architecture specified within these documents may be at various stages of implementation.

In addition to a [formal specification](./regen-ledger.md) that provides a high-level overview of Regen Ledger and its long-term vision, there are two types of specification documents within this directory:

- RFC (Request For Comment)
- ADR (Architecture Decision Record)

## RFC

Anyone with enough technical proficiency can write, edit, and submit an RFC for new functionality or a new feature that they would like to implement or see implemented.

See [RFC Overview](./rfcs) for more information.

## ADR

Architecture decisions are made during the development process while fixing bugs, implementing features, or making other improvements and are recorded for reference.

See [ADR Overview](./adrs) for more information.
