# RFCs

Regen Ledger makes use of RFCs (Requests for Comment) as a method for documenting
proposals and specifications that warrant a more structured process.

It's common that general requirements for new features or modules on Regen Ledger
may begin being discussed as a GitHub issue, GitHub discussion, or on non-GitHub
platforms such as the [community forum](http://forum.regen.network). For larger
features that have a reasonable amount of architectural complexity, RFCs
are encouraged as a mechanism for aligning on a technical approach to a given
set of requirements.

## RFC Creation Process

RFCs should be copied from the [RFC Template](000-template.md) and have sections
designated to outline the Need, Approach, and Rationale - as illustrated in the
template. Inspiration for this format comes from the following article on [Structured RFC Process](https://philcalcado.com/2018/11/19/a_structured_rfc_process.html).

Once the document has moved from DRAFT to IN REVIEW status, it is expected that
community and team members provide feedback until the “__To be reviewed by__” date,
at which point the RFC will be closed to comments, and a decision on whether or
not the proposal is moved forward with will be made. Without an explicit decision
making process noted in the RFC, it is assumed to use consensus decision making.

#### Use RFC 2119 Keywords

When writing RFCs, key words are used to signify the requirements in the
specification. These words are often capitalized: "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
"SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL".
They are to be interpreted as described in
[RFC 2119](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2119).
