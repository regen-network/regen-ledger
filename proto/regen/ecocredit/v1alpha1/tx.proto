    // granular without actually changing any balances. It allows asset issuers to be able to issue an asset without needing
    // to think about how many subdivisions are needed upfront. While it may not be relevant for credits which likely have
    // a fairly stable market value, I wanted to experiment a bit and this serves as a proof of concept for a broader
    // bank redesign where say for instance a coin like the ATOM or XRN could be issued in its own units rather than
    // micro or nano-units. Instead an operation like SetPrecision would allow trading in micro, nano or pico in the future
    // based on market demand. Arbitrary, unbounded precision is not desirable because this can lead to spam attacks (like
    // sending 0.000000000000000000000000000001 coins). This is effectively fixed precision so under the hood it is still
