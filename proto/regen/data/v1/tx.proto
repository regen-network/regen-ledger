  // is true. When anchoring data, the sender is not attesting to the veracity
  // of the data, they are simply communicating that it exists.
  //
  // On-chain signatures have the following benefits:
  // - on-chain identities can be managed using different cryptographic keys
  //   that change over time through key rotation practices
  // - an on-chain identity may represent an organization and through delegation
  //   individual members may sign on behalf of the group
  // - the blockchain transaction envelope provides built-in replay protection
  //   and timestamping
