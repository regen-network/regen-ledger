  // Attest allows for digital signing of an arbitrary piece of data on the
  // blockchain. By attesting to data, the attestor is making a statement about
  // the veracity of the data itself. It is like signing a legal document,
  // meaning that I agree to all conditions and to the best of my knowledge
  // everything is true. When anchoring data, the sender is not attesting to the
  // veracity of the data, they are simply communicating that it exists.
  //
  // On-chain signatures have the following benefits:
  // - on-chain identities can be managed using different cryptographic keys
  //   that change over time through key rotation practices
  // - an on-chain identity may represent an organization and through delegation
  //   individual members may sign on behalf of the group
  // - the blockchain transaction envelope provides built-in replay protection
  //   and timestamping
  //
  // Attest implicitly calls Anchor if the data was not already anchored.
  //
  // Attest can be called multiple times for the same content hash with
  // different attestors and those attestors will be appended to the list of
  // attestors. If the same attestor attempts to attest to the same piece of
  // data, the attestor will be ignored and a new attestation with a new
  // timestamp will not be added.
