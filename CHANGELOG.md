## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.0] - 2021-04-13

This release is the version of regen-ledger that will be used for the mainnet launch of Regen Network's blockchain (chain-id: `regen-1`).

It enables configurable builds for regen ledger (by building with an `EXPERIMENTAL=true/false` build flag). With this new configuration, we've made the following delineation.

* Stable build (EXPERIMENTAL=false) is intended for Regen Network's mainnet, and any testing networks aiming to replicate the mainnet configuration.
  * Includes all standard modules from the Cosmos SDK (bank/staking/gov/etc.), as well as IBC
* Experimental builds, are intended to have more experimental features which have not gone through a full internal audit and are intended for devnets and 3rd party developers who want to work on integrating with future features of regen ledger.
  * In addition to stable build modules, experimental build includes:
    * Regen specific modules (x/ecocredit, x/data)
    * CosmWasm
    * x/group

It is not guaranteed that APIs of features in the experimental build will remain consistent until they are migrated to the stable configuration.

### Added
* make configurable builds (#256)
* add remaining group events
* add group module documentation (#314)

### Changed
* upgrade to Cosmos SDK v0.42.4
* update group tx commands
* remove colon from regen addresses

## [0.6.0] - 2021-02-04

This release contains first iterations of the `x/ecocredit` and `x/data` modules which were launched in a Devnet as part of the Open Climate Collabathon in Nov 2020. 

It is more or less a full rewrite of regen-ledger to upgrade it to Stargate (Cosmos SDK v0.40)

It also includes an initial draft of the `x/group` module for on-chain multisig and DAO use cases.

### Added

* Data Module Proof of Consept (#118)
* Eco-Credit Module Proof of Concept (#119)
* Addition of vuepress docs site: docs.regen.network (#158)
* Add CosmWasm module to regen ledger (#148)
* Add group module (#154)


### Changed

* Custom protobuf service codegen (#207)
* Update to SDK v0.40.0 (#219)
* Remove usage/naming of `gaia` / `XrnApp` / `simd`

## [0.5.0] - 2019-09-21

This release provides the amazonas test upgrade the regen-test-1001 testnet. Specifically this release packages the following changes to the upgrade module:

when an upgrade is planned, the new binary which contains code for the planned upgrade will panic if it is started too early
upgrade scripts are disabled because they were glitchy to setup and not recommended
