# Credit Class, Project and Batch Management

This document provides instructions for managing credit classes, projects and batches through the [command-line interface (CLI)](../ledger/infrastructure/interfaces.html#command-line-interface) or [Regen Marketplace app](https://app.regen.network/).

## Metadata

Credit classes, projects and batches all include an on-chain `metadata` field as a `string`. The `metadata` field is meant to store an Internationalized Resource Identifier (IRI) for resolving  off-chain [JSON-LD](https://json-ld.org/) data.
The expected fields within this JSON-LD data for [credit classes](#credit-class-metadata), projects and batches are documented below.
