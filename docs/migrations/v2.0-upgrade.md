# Upgrade Guide v2.0

This document provides guidelines for node operators upgrading from Regen Ledger v1.0 to v2.0. For a general overview of the upgrade process, please refer to [Upgrade Overview](./upgrade.md).

*Update: A patch release (`v2.1.0`) was released soon-after the v2.0 upgrade. This document has been updated to use the `v2.1.0` as the upgrade binary rather than `v2.0.0`.*

## Upgrade Details

### Regen Ledger v2.0

- [Release Notes](https://github.com/regen-network/regen-ledger/releases/tag/v2.0.0)

### Regen Mainnet

- Upgrade Height: `3003343`

### Redwood Testnet

- Upgrade Height: `548703`

## Upgrade Guidelines

### Update Go

The latest version of Go (`1.17`) is required. For more information, see [Go](https://golang.org/).

### Option 1: Using Cosmovisor

The following instructions assume the `regen` and `cosmovisor` binaries are already installed and `cosmovisor` is set up as a systemd service. If this is not the case, please refer to the [Running a Validator](../getting-started/running-a-validator.md#install-cosmovisor) for instructions on how to install and set up the binaries.

**Cosmovisor 1.0 with the auto-download option disabled is required. Node operators must prepare the upgrade binary in advance.**

::: warning
The auto-download option is not supported in Cosmovisor v1.0 when upgrading from Regen Ledger 1.0 (because it uses Cosmos SDK v0.42). Enabling the auto-download option will result in an error and a failed restart at the time of the upgrade.
:::

#### Configure Cosmovisor

*Note: The following steps are not required if Cosmovisor v1.0 is already installed and configured to your preferred settings.*

To install `cosmovisor`, run the following command:

```bash
go install github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/cosmovisor/cmd/cosmovisor@v1.0
```

Check to ensure the installation was successful:

```bash
cosmovisor version
```

Update `cosmovisor` systemd service file and make sure the environment variables are set to the appropriate values (the following example includes the recommended settings):

```bash
echo "[Unit]
Description=Cosmovisor daemon
After=network-online.target
[Service]
Environment="DAEMON_NAME=regen"
Environment="DAEMON_HOME=${HOME}/.regen"
Environment="DAEMON_RESTART_AFTER_UPGRADE=true"
Environment="DAEMON_ALLOW_DOWNLOAD_BINARIES=false"
Environment="UNSAFE_SKIP_BACKUP=false"
User=${USER}
ExecStart=${GOBIN}/cosmovisor start
Restart=always
RestartSec=3
LimitNOFILE=4096
[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
" >cosmovisor.service
```

Cosmovisor will automatically create a backup of the data directory at the time of the upgrade and before the migration. If you would like to disable the auto-backup, update the following environment variable in the systemd configuration file:

```bash
Environment="UNSAFE_SKIP_BACKUP=true"
```

Move the file to the systemd directory:

```bash
sudo mv cosmovisor.service /lib/systemd/system/cosmovisor.service
```

Restart `cosmovisor` to ensure the environment variables have been updated:

```bash
sudo systemctl stop cosmovisor
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl start cosmovisor
```

Check the status of the `cosmovisor` service:

```bash
sudo systemctl status cosmovisor
```

Enable cosmovisor to start automatically when the machine reboots:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable cosmovisor.service
```

#### Prepare Upgrade Binary

Either download the upgrade binary (`v2.1.0`) or build it from source:

```bash
cd regen-ledger
git fetch --all
git checkout v2.1.0
make build
```

Create the folder for the upgrade binary (`v2.1.0`) and copy the `regen` binary into the folder. This next step assumes that the `regen` binary was built from source and stored in the `build` directory:

```bash
mkdir -p $HOME/.regen/cosmovisor/upgrades/v2.0-upgrade/bin
cp $HOME/regen-ledger/build/regen $HOME/.regen/cosmovisor/upgrades/v2.0-upgrade/bin
```

At the proposed block height, `cosmovisor` will automatically stop the current binary (`v1.0.0`), set the upgrade binary as the new current binary (`v2.1.0`), and then restart the node.

### Option 2: Without Cosmovisor

Using Cosmovisor to perform the upgrade is not mandatory. Node operators also have the option to manually update the `regen` binary at the time of the upgrade.

When the chain halts at the proposed upgrade height, stop the current process running `regen`.

Either download the upgrade binary (`v2.1.0`) or build it from source:

```bash
cd regen-ledger
git fetch --all
git checkout v2.1.0
make install
```

Ensure the `regen` binary has been updated:

```bash
regen version
```

Restart the process running `regen`.
