### Msg
Msg is the regen.ecocredit.v1alpha1 Msg service.

| Method Name | Request Type | Response Type | Description |
| ----------- | ------------ | ------------- | ------------|
| CreateClass | [MsgCreateClass](#regen.ecocredit.v1alpha1.MsgCreateClass) | [MsgCreateClassResponse](#regen.ecocredit.v1alpha1.MsgCreateClassResponse) | CreateClass creates a new credit class with an approved list of issuers and optional metadata. |
| CreateBatch | [MsgCreateBatch](#regen.ecocredit.v1alpha1.MsgCreateBatch) | [MsgCreateBatchResponse](#regen.ecocredit.v1alpha1.MsgCreateBatchResponse) | CreateBatch creates a new batch of credits for an existing credit class. This will create a new batch denom with a fixed supply. Issued credits can be distributed to recipients in either tradable or retired form. |
| Send | [MsgSend](#regen.ecocredit.v1alpha1.MsgSend) | [MsgSendResponse](#regen.ecocredit.v1alpha1.MsgSendResponse) | Send sends tradable credits from one account to another account. Sent credits can either be tradable or retired on receipt. |
| Retire | [MsgRetire](#regen.ecocredit.v1alpha1.MsgRetire) | [MsgRetireResponse](#regen.ecocredit.v1alpha1.MsgRetireResponse) | Retire retires a specified number of credits in the holder's account. |
| Cancel | [MsgCancel](#regen.ecocredit.v1alpha1.MsgCancel) | [MsgCancelResponse](#regen.ecocredit.v1alpha1.MsgCancelResponse) | Cancel removes a number of credits from the holder's account and also deducts them from the tradable supply, effectively cancelling their issuance on Regen Ledger |
| SetPrecision | [MsgSetPrecision](#regen.ecocredit.v1alpha1.MsgSetPrecision) | [MsgSetPrecisionResponse](#regen.ecocredit.v1alpha1.MsgSetPrecisionResponse) | SetPrecision allows an issuer to increase the decimal precision of a credit batch. It is an experimental feature to concretely explore an idea proposed in https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/7113. The number of decimal places allowed for a credit batch is determined by the original number of decimal places used with calling CreatBatch. SetPrecision allows the number of allowed decimal places to be increased, effectively making the supply more granular without actually changing any balances. It allows asset issuers to be able to issue an asset without needing to think about how many subdivisions are needed upfront. While it may not be relevant for credits which likely have a fairly stable market value, I wanted to experiment a bit and this serves as a proof of concept for a broader bank redesign where say for instance a coin like the ATOM or XRN could be issued in its own units rather than micro or nano-units. Instead an operation like SetPrecision would allow trading in micro, nano or pico in the future based on market demand. Arbitrary, unbounded precision is not desirable because this can lead to spam attacks (like sending 0.000000000000000000000000000001 coins). This is effectively fixed precision so under the hood it is still basically an integer, but the fixed precision can be increased so its more adaptable long term than just an integer. |

| <a name="double" /> double |  | double | double | float | float64 | double | float | Float |
| <a name="float" /> float |  | float | float | float | float32 | float | float | Float |
| <a name="int32" /> int32 | Uses variable-length encoding. Inefficient for encoding negative numbers – if your field is likely to have negative values, use sint32 instead. | int32 | int | int | int32 | int | integer | Bignum or Fixnum (as required) |
| <a name="int64" /> int64 | Uses variable-length encoding. Inefficient for encoding negative numbers – if your field is likely to have negative values, use sint64 instead. | int64 | long | int/long | int64 | long | integer/string | Bignum |
| <a name="uint32" /> uint32 | Uses variable-length encoding. | uint32 | int | int/long | uint32 | uint | integer | Bignum or Fixnum (as required) |
| <a name="uint64" /> uint64 | Uses variable-length encoding. | uint64 | long | int/long | uint64 | ulong | integer/string | Bignum or Fixnum (as required) |
| <a name="sint32" /> sint32 | Uses variable-length encoding. Signed int value. These more efficiently encode negative numbers than regular int32s. | int32 | int | int | int32 | int | integer | Bignum or Fixnum (as required) |
| <a name="sint64" /> sint64 | Uses variable-length encoding. Signed int value. These more efficiently encode negative numbers than regular int64s. | int64 | long | int/long | int64 | long | integer/string | Bignum |
| <a name="fixed32" /> fixed32 | Always four bytes. More efficient than uint32 if values are often greater than 2^28. | uint32 | int | int | uint32 | uint | integer | Bignum or Fixnum (as required) |
| <a name="fixed64" /> fixed64 | Always eight bytes. More efficient than uint64 if values are often greater than 2^56. | uint64 | long | int/long | uint64 | ulong | integer/string | Bignum |
| <a name="sfixed32" /> sfixed32 | Always four bytes. | int32 | int | int | int32 | int | integer | Bignum or Fixnum (as required) |
| <a name="sfixed64" /> sfixed64 | Always eight bytes. | int64 | long | int/long | int64 | long | integer/string | Bignum |
| <a name="bool" /> bool |  | bool | boolean | boolean | bool | bool | boolean | TrueClass/FalseClass |
| <a name="string" /> string | A string must always contain UTF-8 encoded or 7-bit ASCII text. | string | String | str/unicode | string | string | string | String (UTF-8) |
| <a name="bytes" /> bytes | May contain any arbitrary sequence of bytes. | string | ByteString | str | []byte | ByteString | string | String (ASCII-8BIT) |
