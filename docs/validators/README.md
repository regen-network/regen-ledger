# Validators

Regen Ledger is built on top of the [Tendermint](https://docs.tendermint.com/v0.35/) Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus algorithm and requires validators to secure the network.

Validators run a full node and participate in consensus by broadcasting votes that contain cryptographic signatures signed by the validator's private key. Validators commit new blocks in the blockchain and receive revenue in exchange for their work.

Validators must also participate in governance by voting on proposals. Validators are weighted according to their total stake.
