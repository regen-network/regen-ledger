# Using Quickstart

We recommend validators become familiar with the manual setup process, but we do have a handy quickstart script available for spinning up a full node from scratch.

This following script will cover the steps in [Initial Setup](README.md), [Install Regen](install-regen.md), and [Initialize Node](initialize-node.md).

*For Regen Mainnet:*

```bash
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/regen-network/mainnet/blob/main/scripts/mainnet-val-setup.sh)
```
