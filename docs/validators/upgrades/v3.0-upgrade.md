# Upgrade Guide v3.0

This document provides guidelines for node operators upgrading from Regen Ledger v2.1 to v3.0. For a general overview of the upgrade process, please refer to [Upgrade Overview](README.md).

## Upgrade Info

### Regen Ledger v3.0

- [Release Notes](https://github.com/regen-network/regen-ledger/releases/tag/v3.0.0)

### Regen Mainnet

- Upgrade Height: `4623339`

### Redwood Testnet

- Upgrade Height: `2459670`

## Upgrade Guidelines

### Update Go

**Go `1.17` or later is required.**

For available downloads, see [Go Downloads](https://go.dev/dl/).

### Option 1: Using Cosmovisor

**Cosmovisor `v1.0` or later is required.**

The following instructions assume the `regen` and `cosmovisor` binaries are already installed and `cosmovisor` is set up as a systemd service. If this is not the case, please refer to [Install Regen](../get-started/run-a-full-node.md#install-regen) and [Install Cosmovisor](../get-started/run-a-full-node.md#install-cosmovisor) for instructions on how to install and set up the binaries.

::: warning Auto-Download Not Recommended
Cosmovisor provides an auto-download option that prevents the need for any additional set up in preparing for the upgrade. Although available to validators, this feature is only intended for use with full nodes and validators should build the binary from source.
:::

Build the upgrade binary (`v3.0.0`) from source:

```bash
cd regen-ledger
git fetch --all
git checkout v3.0.0
make build
```

Ensure the `regen` binary has been built:

```bash
./build/regen version
```

You should see the following:

```bash
v3.0.0
```

Create a `v3.0.0-upgrade` directory and copy the upgrade binary (`v3.0.0`) to the folder:

```bash
mkdir -p $HOME/.regen/cosmovisor/upgrades/v3.0.0/bin
cp ./build/regen $HOME/.regen/cosmovisor/upgrades/v3.0.0/bin
```

At the proposed block height, `cosmovisor` will automatically stop the current binary (`v2.1.0`), set the upgrade binary as the current binary (`v3.0.0`), and then (depending on the cosmovisor settings) perform a backup and restart the node.

### Option 2: Without Cosmovisor

Using Cosmovisor to perform the upgrade is not mandatory. Node operators also have the option to manually update the `regen` binary at the time of the upgrade.

When the chain halts at the proposed upgrade height, stop the current process running `regen`.

Build the upgrade binary (`v3.0.0`) from source:

```bash
cd regen-ledger
git fetch --all
git checkout v3.0.0
make install
```

Ensure the `regen` binary has been updated:

```bash
regen version
```

You should see the following:

```bash
v3.0.0
```

Restart the process running `regen`.
