## regen keys export

Export private keys

### Synopsis

Export a private key from the local keyring in ASCII-armored encrypted format.

When both the --unarmored-hex and --unsafe flags are selected, cryptographic
private key material is exported in an INSECURE fashion that is designed to
allow users to import their keys in hot wallets. This feature is for advanced
users only that are confident about how to handle private keys work and are
FULLY AWARE OF THE RISKS. If you are unsure, you may want to do some research
and export your keys in ASCII-armored encrypted format.

```
regen keys export <name> [flags]
