## regen tx sign-batch

Sign transaction batch files

### Synopsis

Sign batch files of transactions generated with --generate-only.
The command processes list of transactions from file (one StdTx each line), generate
signed transactions or signatures and print their JSON encoding, delimited by '\n'.
As the signatures are generated, the command updates the account sequence number accordingly.

If the --signature-only flag is set, it will output the signature parts only.

The --offline flag makes sure that the client will not reach out to full node.
As a result, the account and the sequence number queries will not be performed and
it is required to set such parameters manually. Note, invalid values will cause
the transaction to fail. The sequence will be incremented automatically for each
transaction that is signed.

The --multisig=<multisig_key> flag generates a signature on behalf of a multisig
account key. It implies --signature-only.


```
regen tx sign-batch [file] [flags]
```

### Options

```
  -a, --account-number uint      The account number of the signing account (offline mode only)
  -b, --broadcast-mode string    Transaction broadcasting mode (sync|async|block) (default "sync")
      --dry-run                  ignore the --gas flag and perform a simulation of a transaction, but don't broadcast it
      --fee-account string       Fee account pays fees for the transaction instead of deducting from the signer
      --fees string              Fees to pay along with transaction; eg: 10uatom
      --from string              Name or address of private key with which to sign
      --gas string               gas limit to set per-transaction; set to "auto" to calculate sufficient gas automatically (default 200000)
      --gas-adjustment float     adjustment factor to be multiplied against the estimate returned by the tx simulation; if the gas limit is set manually this flag is ignored  (default 1)
      --gas-prices string        Gas prices in decimal format to determine the transaction fee (e.g. 0.1uatom)
      --generate-only            Build an unsigned transaction and write it to STDOUT (when enabled, the local Keybase is not accessible)
  -h, --help                     help for sign-batch
      --keyring-backend string   Select keyring's backend (os|file|kwallet|pass|test|memory) (default "os")
      --keyring-dir string       The client Keyring directory; if omitted, the default 'home' directory will be used
      --ledger                   Use a connected Ledger device
      --multisig string          Address or key name of the multisig account on behalf of which the transaction shall be signed
      --node string              <host>:<port> to tendermint rpc interface for this chain (default "tcp://localhost:26657")
      --note string              Note to add a description to the transaction (previously --memo)
      --offline                  Offline mode (does not allow any online functionality
  -o, --output string            Output format (text|json) (default "json")
      --output-document string   The document will be written to the given file instead of STDOUT
  -s, --sequence uint            The sequence number of the signing account (offline mode only)
      --sign-mode string         Choose sign mode (direct|amino-json), this is an advanced feature
      --signature-only           Print only the generated signature, then exit (default true)
      --timeout-height uint      Set a block timeout height to prevent the tx from being committed past a certain height
  -y, --yes                      Skip tx broadcasting prompt confirmation
```
